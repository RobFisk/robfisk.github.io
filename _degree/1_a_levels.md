Studied my A-Levels at John Port Spencer Academy. Alongside my studies I was the Head Boy of my sixth form, working to lead student representation and student-led support like the prefect teams and disability needs support through a year in which we'd just been allowed to return to school after the first wave of the COVID pandemic. This also meant interesting challenges helping the sixth form figure out its COVID response to help reduction the spread. 

Grades :
 * A* Mathematics
 * A* Physics 
 * A* Computer Science
 * A* Further Mathematics
 * *Also achieved a 3rd + 2nd in the STEP 2/3 exams, used as an entry requirement for Cambridge University. 

 For international readers, the standard in state schools in the UK is to do 3 A-levels and either core maths or a project called an EPQ, though my school allowed me to take 4 A-levels to push myself and I think it worked out.
