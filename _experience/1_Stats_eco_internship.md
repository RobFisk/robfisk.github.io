Worked as a research intern alongside experts David Borchers and Cornelia Oedekoven from the University of St Andrews. During the work, I worked to gather relevant research materials; assist with data collection and analysis using mathematical and statistical models; and collaborate with researchers to implement statistical methodologies in R.

Specifically, the project I worked on used cutting-edge Acoustic Spatial Capture-Recapture (AScR) methods to generate animal density estimates using calls they make detected by microphones. My key involvement was in helping clear up and document existing R code and then investigating the effects of angle errors made by faulty microphones on density estimates, as this was an issue the researchers were running into.

Some key skills I improved upon were:
 * R
 * Statistical Modelling
 * Research skills
 * Communicating findings from research
