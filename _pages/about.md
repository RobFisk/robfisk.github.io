Welcome to my personal website!
======
I’m Rob! An aspiring data scientist and current MMath Masters in Mathematics student at the University of St Andrews. I’m passionate about using statistics to wrangle large, complicated datasets into digestible insights anyone can interact with. I truly believe data and statistical literacy are necessary tools to help us understand the rapidly changing world we live in. 

From the first statistics class I had at secondary school I really fell in love with the field. I think my teacher Mr Howitt had a great deal to do with this, as he had us challenge statistics like “9 out of 10 dentists recommend”. The need for high quality, well-contextualised statistical insights and strong critical thinking becomes only clearer as the amount of data about us all increases and statistics are more frequently used without proper context to mislead people. Now at university I’ve had the pleasure of studying advanced statistical techniques in Bayesian Inference or Stochastic Dynamics as well as demonstrating how using tools from the advanced to basics effectively can generate meaningful insights in coursework like my 1911 Census Exploratory Data Analysis. I also enjoy reading and thinking about the philosophy of statistics as I study in my degree and work on personal projects, with a personal favourite book of mine being “The Spirit Level” by academics Kate Pickett and Richard Wilkinson.

I’ve always had excellent computing, programming and analysis skills having first started programming with Python and Scratch as a seven year old after I got a Raspberry Pi for Christmas. Since then I’ve kept learning new ways to code, new techniques and new skills every day. From coding minecraft mods as a little kid to creating informative visualisations for energy companies to studying advanced machine learning techniques, I never lost the passion for building coding projects and finding new ways to work with computers.

All my life I’ve topped my classes particularly in mathematics and the sciences, and my academic record is excellent which points to really strong reasoning and critical thinking skills. I had top GCSE and perfect A-Level results at my secondary school, which I’ve followed up while at the top university in the UK (Times, Guardian rankings). Here, I’ve been placed on the Deans’ list for academic excellence every year I’ve attended and am on track for a strong first-class degree. Additionally, I was awarded the MMath Third Level Medal in Statistics for getting the top grades in program during my third year, an achievement that makes me especially proud as this was the year my mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer so I was battling through a lot while studying. 

Outside of data science, I’m mostly interested in trying to make the world around me a better place, being involved in community building action within my roles as Senior Student at my hall of residence, Logistics Officer for a foodbank collection society and as part of student protest groups. I’m always the type of person that will meet others with a smile and give 110% to whatever I’m involved in. I love to read especially about history and politics, play and talk about football, work out and spend time with my wonderful girlfriend Alani. 

Professionally, I’m enthusiastic and keen to learn from those around me while working in dynamic teams. I have excellent communication and leadership skills developed in my roles in student communication and can be counted on to work to deadlines. I’m able to pick up new skills in any discipline quickly and am always keen to think about the bigger picture when working on small parts of a project. 

I’m mostly seeking graduate/intermediate jobs in Data Science, Data Analytics and communication using data and statistics, but the skills I’ve gained through my life and degree should set me up well for any role involving problem solving, logical thinking and analysis so I’m open to all kinds of work. 

Please take a look at a selection of some projects I've worked on/studied and my work experience, each piece of which is a hyperlink you can click on to learn more. Also available is a summary of the skills I've developed and a blog post where I (very occasionally) write about statistics in the news. Have a great day!
