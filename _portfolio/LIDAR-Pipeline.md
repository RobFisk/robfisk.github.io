title: "Processing LIDAR images to create elevation models"
excerpt: "Part of a summer project on using machine learning to identify plant species from drone images. Learned to use pix4dmapper and QGIS to process LIDAR images into an elevation model (DEM), as well as creating an educational resource to help taught Master's students at the University of Glasgow to do the same.<br/><img src='/images/stew_point_cloud.png' width='400'>"

As part of a research project on Monitoring Vegetation usign Machine Learning, I had to learn how to proccess UAV drone images to make... this was a new skill for me but by the end I was ab le to produce educational resources for future Master;s degree students to use...

I had to work in QGIS, Pix4d, ...

The DEM () produced looks like ...
