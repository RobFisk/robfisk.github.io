title: "Demonstrating Computer Vision Tools for Elevation Models"
excerpt: "Part of a summer project on using machine learning to identify plant species from drone images. Learned about and implemented cutting edge computer vision models and demonstrated their strengths and weakness for a dataset of field images in East Ayrshire from the project.<br/><img src='/images/unsam.jpg' width='400'>"

For the second half of my summer project on Monitoring Vegetation using Machine Learning, I wanted to prepare images for classifiers...

Initially, we'd hoped to ... but due to ... had to settle for ...

The computer vision models used were ...

Solving the challemnges I came across with ... required ...

In the end, I was able to produce masks looking like this ... as well as a good tutorial for future ...

My supervisors said they were really impressed with what i'd been able to deliver while only working part time on the project and with so little support, and they loved how I'd remained focused on setting up future PhD research into the area throughout my project and while presenting my findings. ...

Humble brag got offered a PhD, whihc one day I might take up.
