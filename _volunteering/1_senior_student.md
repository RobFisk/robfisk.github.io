excerpt: "(October 2022 â€” May 2024) 
          <br>Lead the committee of my hall of residence in work to represent residents, run student-led events and ensure the hall was a safe and welcoming space. My work resulted in the highest committee approval ratings (97%) since student union records, something I'm greatly proud of."

Acting initially as the events co-ordinator and then as senior student for the John Burnet Student Committee, I was responsible for representing students to residential services, the students union, and university accommodation in St Andrews. Being events co-ordinator involved managing events - from small scale social events to large scale balls - to improve the student experience for all residents. Then as the senior student I led a committee of 20 people in a variety of student-led projects to improve student wellbeing, health and safety and set the university hall committees of the future up well to do the same. I also maintained an excellent relationship with the staff, eventually leading me to help the university in the hiring process for expansions to the pastoral team.

Throughout my time with the committee, good people management, communication and leadership skills have been crucial to ensure that the volunteer team are able to function best. I have also developed excellent time-management, co-ordination and problem solving skills and a great composure under pressure. 

Under my leadership, resident approval ratings skyrocketed to the highest they've been in John Burnet since student union records began - 97% - and I really enjoyed delivering the best experience possible for the student community around me.

Some key skills I improved upon were:
