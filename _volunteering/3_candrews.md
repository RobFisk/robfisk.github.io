During my degree I volunteered for 'St Candrews', a student society that raises donations for a local foodbank. My role as Logistics Officer involved coordinating the collection and delivery of food donations, ensuring that everything ran smoothly and efficiently. In addition to this I helped organise and run events, come up with ideas for fundraisers and support my colleagues with aspects of their roles too. This experience allowed me to develop my organizational and communication skills while contributing to a meaningful cause in my community.
